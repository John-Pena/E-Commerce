## Description
This project was an assignment to challenge my knowledge of back-end programming. It extended my knowledge of using Sequelize to communicate with MySQL database. Using Sequelize, I was able to seed data into the database. Once this data was seeded into the database, we had to create routes using Express.js to allow this data to be pulled from the database.

## Installation
Git clone the repository into your preferred location on your PC. Open the root of the repository. Ensure you have Node.js, Express.js, Sequelize, MySQL database, MySQL2, and dotenv installed on your PC and inside the root of your repository.

## Usage
This application is used inside the root terminal of the repository. Routes are tested inisde of Insomnia using http://localhost to test all routes.

## Test
Open your terminal, and open up your MySQL database inside the terminal and source the name of th database (ecommerce_db). Ensure you USE ecommerce_db. Exit MySQL terminal. Make sure you have seed inserted in your package.json for the next step. Run npm run seed sinde the terminal. This will seed all the data to the database. Run npm start to boot up the server. Open up Insomnia and test the API routes.
